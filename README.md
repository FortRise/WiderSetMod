## Quest

+ The quest saves are separated from original, so you have to unlock all of the quest level again but in Wide levels. (or use cheats to unlock all levels).

## DarkWorld (WIP)

This mod brings a way to play both Standard and Wider set. So you don't have to remove this mod when you want to play the original set.

### This project is still on ALPHA, please report bugs if you find one.
